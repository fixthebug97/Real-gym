Sadly too many people have experienced this, but now it’s a thing of the past. Here at Goldstone, our staff members are not just highly qualified and knowledgeable, but also friendly, approachable and fun! They all have a keen personal interest in keeping fit or playing sports so can relate to you and your needsNever used a gym before? Nervous or unsure about what to do? Don’t Worry! Once you become a member we don’t just give you a membership card and tell you to figure it out on your own. A member of staff will fully induct you into the gym. This means they will walk you through the gym floor explaining all the machines and equipment, how to use them correctly, what they do, and how to maintain technique in repetitions.</b></p></div>
