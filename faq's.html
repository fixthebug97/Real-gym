<h1>THE CONCEPT</h1>
<a>The price sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?</a>
<p>There isn't one! We work hard to keep the costs low so you can forget your finances and focus on your fitness!</p><br/><br/>
<a>What do you mean by 'no contract'?</a>
<p>We'll never tie you into a membership for a set period. In fact, you'll only ever pay for one month at a time and can leave at any time.</p><br/><br/>
<a>Are your gyms really open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year?</a>
<p>Yes they are, 365 days a year!</p><br/><br/>

<h1>MEMBERSHIP</h1>
<a>How old do I need to be to join PureGym?</a><p>At least 18 years old.
</p><br/><br/>
<a>Can I trial Pure Gym before joining?</a><p>Of course. Due to the PIN entry system to our gyms we can't offer complimentary visits but you can purchase a one-day, three-day or seven-day pass from our website.</p><br/><br/>
<a>Can I delay the start of my membership?</a><p>Yes, you can delay your membership by up to 3 months from the day you join. </p><br/><br/>
<a>Will I get a PureGym membership card?</a><p>Rather than a card, you'll get a unique pin number that'll give you access to the gym via a keypad, and access to the members area of the website.</p><br/><br/>
<a>Can I freeze my membership?</a><p>Yes, for up to 3 months for just £5.99 a month. You can freeze and unfreeze your membership using the members area of our website. When you unfreeze your membership, your first monthly payment may be slightly more or less than usual due to the system calculating a pro-rata figure for the days your membership was frozen.</p><br/><br/>
<a>Can I let other people use my PIN number?</a><p>No. To protect our members' interests and safety, entrances to our gyms are monitored by CCTV 24 hours a day. Any members found flouting this rule will have their membership cancelled.</p><br/><br/>

<h1>SECURITY</h1>
<a>Is there CCTV at PureGym? </a><p>Yes, and it's linked directly to the emergency services. Staff are also on site between 6am and 10pm. If you need assistance during these times simply press one of the call buttons located throughout the gym. </p><br/><br/>
<a>Is the PureGym website secure?</a><p>Yes. Our application form is secure, your details will be encrypted and personal details will be kept private. To find out more, check out the privacy statement on our website</p><br/><br/>
