<div id="section-b"><br/><p>The barbell is a long iron bar that is between 4 and 7 feet long on which weight plates and placed. Barbell exercises are performed by holding the barbell with both hands.

At the top of the list are Olympic barbells. They are 7 feet long and weigh 45 lbs. These are heavy-duty bars that can handle huge weight loads of over 800 lbs. Some Olympic bars can handle weight loads of over 1000 lbs. Because they are so big they are used mostly for heavy basic exercises such as bench press, squats, and dead lifts.

There are smaller versions of the Olympic barbell that are between 4-6 feet long. These bars are generally used for smaller exercises such as barbell curls, shoulder presses, bent rows, etc...

Many gyms also have a barbell rack that has an assortment of fixed weight barbells. They usually have barbells that are from 20 - 100 lbs. in increments of 5-10 lbs. (i.e. a 20 lb. bar, 30 lb. bar, 40 lb. bar, etc...).

<div id="section3"><br/><div id="section-img"><img src="dbrack.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/></div>
<div id="section-b"><br/><p>There are also adjustable dumbbells that have small collars that clip on the ends of the dumbbells to hold the weight plates. While they are not a convenient as a rack of fixed weight dumbbells, they are much cheaper and take up less space. They are ideal for a home gym setting. 

Weight plates range from 2.5 lbs. to 100 lbs. They are usually iron, however, many home gyms have plastic weight plates. Many people are familiar with the York Plastic Barbell Set. While this is ok for someone who is just starting out, the thickness of the plastic weight plates limit the amount of weight that can be placed on the barbell and dumbbells.

All weight plates found in commercial gyms are made of iron. There are two types of iron weight plates - Olympic plates for the Olympic barbells and standard weight plates for the 1 inch thick standard size barbells.</p> </div>

<div id="section-b"><br/><p>There are several different types of rack found in the gym. There are racks that are used for storing weight plates (also called weight trees). There are racks for storing barbells, dumbbell racks, etc.

There are also racks for doing exercises such as the power rack or squat rack. There is also a special rack/machine called the smith machine, which is a combination of a machine and free weight barbell.
